# Little JsDocs Try

* I was just trying to see how reversing LinkedLists actually works because I had never tried and told myself that it may be an opportunity to try out the Javascript documentation generator ```JsDoc``` in the meantime and to show my *documentation skills*

##Prerequisites

* You have ```node``` and ```npm``` installed
* You really want to read the documentation (ahah)

##Install

* run 
    ```bash 
    npm install @babel/core @babel/register @babel/preset-env --save-dev
    ```
* run 
    ```bash 
    npm start
    ```
